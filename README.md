# 🔁 Linked List Cycle Detection

This project demonstrates how to detect a **cycle** in a linked list and find the **starting node** of that cycle using **Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare Algorithm)** in Java.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, determine if there is a cycle.  
If a cycle exists, return the node where the cycle begins.  
If there is no cycle, return `null`.

A **cycle** means that the last node’s `next` pointer points to some previous node in the list.

## 🧩 Example

### Input:
3
1 3 4
2



### Output:
3



### Explanation:
The linked list looks like:
1 -> 3 -> 4
^ |
|_____|
